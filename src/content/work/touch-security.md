## Description

The Incident Management Application is a project I developed using C# and .NET framework. It serves as a comprehensive solution for managing incidents in commercial locations. The application includes an API created with .NET and SQL Server for data storage and retrieval, and a desktop interface developed in C#.

### Key Features

- CRUD Operations: The application allows users to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on incidents, providing a seamless workflow for incident management.

- Company Management: Users can manage companies associated with commercial locations, including creating new companies, updating their information, and deleting them if necessary.

- Reporting Functionality: The application provides robust reporting capabilities, enabling users to generate detailed reports on incident data, such as incident types, frequencies, and trends.

- Location-based Visualization: The application leverages mapping capabilities to visualize companies based on their geographical locations. This feature provides a clear overview of the distribution of commercial locations and helps identify trends or patterns.

- Security and Authentication: The application ensures data security by implementing secure authentication mechanisms to control access and protect sensitive information.
